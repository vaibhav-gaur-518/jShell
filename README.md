# A basic Java shell that supports essential commands like goto, show, clear, and more!

## ✅ Implemented essential commands for file and directory management:
### create: Create new directories and files with ease.
### delete: Remove files and directories, including the option for recursive deletion using --force custom flag!
### help: Get comprehensive information about all available commands at your fingertips.

## ✅ Preview Feature: To get a sneak peek at the contents of a file. This helps prevent mistakes!
## ✅ Command History: I’ve implemented a history feature that stores previously used commands, making it easier for you to recall and reuse them.
## ✅ Interactive Edit Feature: You can now modify the contents of the specified file (add new lines or update existing lines).

## ✅ File and Directory Copy with Unique Naming: If you copy a file or directory to the same location, the system now generates unique names like file_copy1.txt or directory_copy1/ to avoid overwrites.
## ✅ Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works smoothly on both Unix-based and Windows systems.
